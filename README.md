# Econometrics_Project

This project uses consumer survey data from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers to examine the effect of personal and non-personal variables on consumersâ€™ expectations for future economic performance. The years 2011 to 2019 have been chosen for this analysis. Results indicate that both personal and non-personal variables have statistically significant explanatory power for consumer economic expectations. Expectation of personal finances for the following year has the strongest influence of the personal variables. It is also found that the marginal influences of some variables change depending on whether the change in the S&P500 index price is positive or negative.

Analysis is conducted using SAS and data is prepared using Jupiter Notebook

In order to execute the .ipynb and .sas files, download all .csv files from this repository and save them in the same location as the .ipynb before running. 

To further understand the data preparation and data analysis conducted in this project, please refer to the paper "Econometric Analysis of the Determinants of Consumer Expectations".

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my project!
